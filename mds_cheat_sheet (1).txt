mdsconnect('landau.hit');   % connects to the dataserver, if on vpn and/or dns is not set up correctly, its 10.10.10.189 on the UW plasma network
mdsopen('hitsiu',shot_number); % opens the shot_number discharge, shot numbers are YYMMDDSSS,  YY=year, MM=month, DD=day, SSS=shotnumber ex. 220721026
				% 0 is last shot that was taken.   -1 is the 'model tree', empty shot with all the current input settings
sig = mdsvalue('NODE'); % get the data for NODE.  Most nodes begin with a \. 
time = mdsvalue('dim_of(NODE)');  % get the timebase for the node


Circuit nodes:
# is 1,2,3,4 on hitsiu.   # is a,b,c on hitsi3.    # is x,y on hitsi
\v_div_#_fspa : voltage of flux spa # (L1)
\v_div_#_fc : voltage of flux coil # (L2)
\i_fcoil_# : current through flux coil # (L2)
\i_spa_f# : current through flux spa # (L1)
\sihi_freq : frequency the injectors are operating at

some mdstcl functions:
zrat(sig1,sig2) : computes hilbert(sig1) / hilbert(sig2), should give the complex impedance

imp_L2 = mdsvalue('zrat(\v_div_1_fc,\i_1_fcoil)'); % this should give the complex impedance of L2


sihi_smooth : boxcar averages signal at injector frequency
